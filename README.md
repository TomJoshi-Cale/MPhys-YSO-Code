# MPhys Python Code Sample

This repo contains some examples of the types of python scripts that I created as part of my MPhys project, 'Using Structure Functions to Investigate the Long-Timescale Variability of Young Stellar Objects'. The code was written solely by me, but used by all members of the project. Also included is the workflow reminder I created for the most common usage of the pipeline (Workflow.md).

Since the data used was many files, if you would like to see them you can visit [my Onedrive](https://1drv.ms/u/s!Aj-ZG4vP0RwQlHLPBGKg0EvhEhi-?e=5PaZnw). The Non-Variable stars referred to in Workflow.md are in the '_Golden Region Binned_' folder, and the sample of ZTF lightcurves to be unpacked by `SeparateBin.py` is `ZTFxPovich_Cl2.txt`
