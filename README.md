# MPhys Python Code Sample

This repo contains some examples of the types of python scripts that I created as part of my MPhys project, 'Using Structure Functions to Investigate the Long-Timescale Variability of Young Stellar Objects'. The code was written solely by me, but used by all members of the project. Also included is the workflow reminder I created for the most common usage of the pipeline (Workflow.md), an example inputted datafile (ZTFxPovichCl1.txt, a selection of likely Class I candidates observed with the ZTF telescope and classified by MYStIX survey Povich et al criteria) and the non-variable stars from the _'Golden Region'_
